def tournament(rng, population, n):
	'''
	Selects "n" Individuals from the population and return a 
	single Individual.

	Parameters:
	population (list): A list of Individuals, sorted from best to worse.

def double_tournament(rng, population, tournament_size, sp, sf, switch):
	'''
	Runs a double tournament selection process to select the best Individual from a population.

	The double tournament consists of two rounds of tournament selection, where the first round selects 
	'sf' individuals based on fitness (when switch = False) or 'sp' individuals based on size (when switch = True),
	and the second round selects the best individual among the winners of the first round, but using the
	opposite criteria (i.e., size when fitness was used in the first round, and vice versa). The purpose
	of the switch parameter is to alternate the criteria used in the first round between size and fitness.

	Parameters:
	- rng (numpy.random.Generator): A random number generator.
	- population (list): A list of Individuals, sorted from best to worse according to the first criterion
		used in the first round of the double tournament (i.e., fitness if switch = False, size if switch = True).
	- tournament_size (int): The size of each tournament in the first round.
	- sp (int): The number of Individuals selected in the first round based on size (when switch = True) or
		the second tournament size (when switch = False).
	- sf (int): The number of Individuals selected in the first round based on fitness (when switch = False) or
		the second tournament size (when switch = True).
	- switch (bool): A flag to switch between using size or fitness in the first round of the double tournament.

	Returns:
	The best Individual selected by the double tournament
